# Can I install Dynamsoft Service silently? 

Yes. The following are the commands for this purpose

* Windows

``` shell
msiexec  /i  "/path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.msi"   /qn
```

* macOS

``` shell
// Install
sudo installer -pkg /path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.pkg -target /Applications
// Stop service
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dynamsoft.dynamsoftservicex64.plist
// Start service
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dynamsoft.dynamsoftservicex64.plist
```

* Linux

``` shell
sudo dpkg -i  /path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.deb
```

or

``` shell
sudo rpm -i path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.rpm
```

And in a controlled environment, Dynamsoft Service can be distributed to all clients in one go just like other similar programs. [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-install-software) is one such technology.
